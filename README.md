# budget-planner

## Project Objective

Hello, stranger

This passion project is focused on creating my own personal budget planner application for two purposes: to hone my python skills and manipulate my finance data more freely than Excel.

The following project is built upon dash and dash-bootstrap-components ~~with ramen too~~.

| library                   | versions  |
| ------------------------- |-----------|
| python                    | 3.9.12    |
| dash                      | 2.4.1     |
| dash-bootstrap-components | 1.1.0     |
| dash-core-components      | 2.0.0     |
| pandas                    | 1.4.2     |
| sqlite3                   | 3.38.3    |
