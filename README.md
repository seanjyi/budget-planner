# budget-planner

## Project Objective

Hello, random person from the world. This project is focused on creating my own personal budget planner application for two purposes. One is to learn about python; the other reason is to manipulate my data more freely than Excel ~~of course to build my resume too~~. 

The following project is built upon dash and dash-bootstrap-components. 

Priority One List
- sql implementation
- drop down vs improve reading in csv possibly
- settings
- expense 
- home

Priority Two List
- table width
