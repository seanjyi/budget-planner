# budget-planner

## Project Objective

Hello, random person from the world. This project is focused on creating my own personal budget planner application for two purposes. One is to learn about python; the other reason is to manipulate my data more freely than Excel ~~of course to build my resume too~~. 

The following project is built upon dash and dash-bootstrap-components. 


DataTable
> improve header
> make df remember (i.e. pg size)
> can save (if income.csv exists make it a backup then save as income.csv)
> format data table
> drop down vs improve reading in csv possibly
